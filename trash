% As the class of semirings grows, the left condition becomes stronger, and thus the implication $\implies$ becomes easier to prove, while the converse implication $\impliedby$ becomes harder to prove. In fact, the implication $\impliedby$ is false in the first variant (as we have seen in Example~\ref{ex:not-regular-but-continuous-over-finite-fields}), and the implication $\implies$ is false in the last case, as we will see in Example~\ref{ex:all-semirings}. The remaining middle two variants, of which  Conjecture~\ref{conj:regular-continuous} is the upper one, are still open, and we believe that both of them are true (and in particular the two middle kinds of continuity are the same).
% The following diagram summarises what we know and conjecture about the implications (known facts are in black, and conjectures are in red).
