\section{String outputs}
\label{sec:string-outputs}

In this section, we consider the case where the output domain is strings over some finite alphabet. We use the name \emph{string-to-string function} for any function of type $\Sigma^* \to \Gamma^*$, where both alphabets $\Sigma$ and $\Gamma$ are finite. For such functions, the protocols are assumed to use the output domain $\Gamma^*$, equipped with concatenation. 
 In the case of string-to-string functions, we conjecture that protocols define exactly the so-called regular functions, which will be formally defined in Section~\ref{sec:regular-string-to-string-functions} below.
 


\begin{conjecture}\label{conj:protocol-regular-string-to-string}
    A string-to-string function is computed by a protocol if and only if it is regular. 
\end{conjecture}

In Section~\ref{sec:regular-string-to-string-functions} we  define the regular functions from the above conjecture, and we prove the $\impliedby$ implication: every regular function is computed by a protocol. The content of the conjecture is therefore the $\implies$ implication, namely that protocols can only compute regular functions and nothing more.  In Section~\ref{sec:continuity}, we present some evidence for the conjecture, by showing that string-to-string functions computed by protocols share many good properties of the regular functions, such as linear output size and computability. In Section~\ref{sec:unary-output-alphabet}, we present further evidence for the conjecture, namely we  prove it in the special case where the output alphabet has only one letter (the remaining case is two output letters, since more letters do not change the situation). Finally, in Section~\ref{sec:beyond-fields}, we discuss variants of the conjecture that are related to weighted automata which are not over a field, but over an arbitrary semiring.
