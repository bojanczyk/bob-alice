\section{String outputs}
\label{sec:string-outputs}
\AP
In this section, we consider the case where the \kl{output domain} is strings over
some finite alphabet. We use the name \intro{string-to-string function} for any
function of type $\Sigma^* \to \Gamma^*$, where both alphabets $\Sigma$ and
$\Gamma$ are finite. For such functions, the \kl{protocols} are assumed to use the
output domain of strings $\Gamma^*$ equipped with concatenation. In the case of
\kl{string-to-string functions}, we conjectured, see
Conjecture~\ref{conj:protocol-regular-string-to-string},  that protocols define
exactly the so-called \kl{regular functions}, which will be formally defined in
Section~\ref{sec:regular-string-to-string-functions} below.

The content of this section is an extended discussion of this conjecture.
In Section~\ref{sec:regular-string-to-string-functions} we  formally
define the \kl{regular functions} and  prove the implication 
\begin{align*}
\text{protocol} \impliedby \text{regular}.
\end{align*}
The content of the conjecture is therefore the implication 
\begin{align*}
\text{protocol} \implies \text{regular}.
\end{align*}

In Section~\ref{sec:continuity}, we present some evidence for this implication.
We show that \kl{string-to-string functions} computed by \kl{protocols} share
many good properties of the \kl{regular functions}, such as linear output size
and computability. In Section~\ref{sec:unary-output-alphabet}, we present
further evidence for the implication, namely we  prove it in the special case
where the output alphabet has only one letter (the remaining case is two output
letters, since more letters do not change the situation). Finally, in
Section~\ref{sec:beyond-fields}, we discuss variants of the conjecture that are
related to weighted automata which are not over a field, but over an arbitrary
semiring.
