\section{String outputs}
\label{sec:string-outputs}

In this section, we consider the case where the output domain is strings over some finite alphabet. We use the name \emph{string-to-string function} for any function of type $\Sigma^* \to \Gamma^*$, where both alphabets $\Sigma$ and $\Gamma$ are finite. For such functions, the protocols are assumed to use the output domain $\Gamma^*$, equipped with concatenation. 
 In the case of string-to-string functions, we conjecture that protocols define exactly the so-called regular functions, which will be formally defined in Section~\ref{sec:regular-string-to-string-functions} below.
 


\begin{conjecture}\label{conj:protocol-regular-string-to-string}
    A string-to-string function is computed by a protocol if and only if it is regular. 
\end{conjecture}

In Section~\ref{sec:regular-string-to-string-functions} we  define the regular functions from the above conjecture, and we prove the $\impliedby$ implication: every regular function is computed by a protocol. The content of the conjecture is therefore the $\implies$ implication, namely that protocols can only compute regular functions and nothing more.  In Section~\ref{sec:} In Section~\ref{sec:unary-output-alphabet}, we prove the conjecture in the special case where the output alphabet has only one letter.
