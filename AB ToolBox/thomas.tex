Moreover, $ c(u,v) \le c'(q,q') $ therefore for any $ w \in \Sigma^* $, $ \norm{f_A[q](w),f_A[q'](w)} \le c'(q,q') $.

% End of the proof

As a consequence of this lemma and of properties of $ \RS $, we obtain that $ \Simil $ is an equivalence relation over $ Q_B $ and that $ \Simil $ has a congruence-like property, namely for any three strings $ u,v,w \in \Sigma^* $, if $ u \Simil v $ then $ wu \Simil wv $. In particular, given a string $ u \in \Sigma^* $, the equivalence class of $ q_B(u) $ can be computed by a right to left finite deterministic automaton. An other observation is that the equivalence classes of $ \Simil $ are exactly the images by $ q_B $ of those of $ \RS $ and conversely, the equivalence classes of $ \RS $ are exactly the inverse images of those of $ \Simil $.
