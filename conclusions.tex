\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusions}
One could possibly consider other inputs, such as trees. It seems that at least some of our results could generalise to such inputs, as long as there would be a suitable theory of automata for the inputs, with theorems in the style of Myhill-Nerode (which is the case for trees). Nevertheless, we leave the the exploration of non-string inputs to future work.
