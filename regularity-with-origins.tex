\subsection{Regularity with origins}
\label{sec:origin-semantics}

In this section, we provide further evidence for
Conjectures~\ref{conj:protocol-regular-string-to-string}
and~\ref{conj:regular-continuous}, by showing that they are true under the
so-called \kl{origin semantics}
\cite{bojanczykTransducersOriginInformation2014}.

\begin{theorem}
  \label{thm:origin-string-to-string}
  A function $f: \Sigma^* \to \Gamma^*$ is computable by a
  \kl{two-party protocol} with string inputs under the \kl{origin semantics} if and only if
  it is a \kl{regular function} with origins.
\end{theorem}
